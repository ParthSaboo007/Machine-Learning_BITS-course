#Data Collection: 
                For obtaining a variety of data, we had collected data from more than one email ID’s including the personal and Bits mail id.
We have used Subject, Body and sender as three of the mail for classification into labels. We had chosen six labels to distribute the collected data. 

Steps followed for data collection are as follows:

Step1 - Created six labels in gmail labels.
Step2 - Classified mails under the selected labels manually
Step3 - Created python code to extract subject, body, sender’s address into a CSV file from the mails.
Step4 - We used Gmail API to access the emails and extracted it by using a python script.

# Data Cleaning:
We cleaned data at several layers
1) Removed html tags
2) Removed emojis
3) Removed characters excluding A-Z and 1-9
4) Lemmatized text of the mails
5) Removed stop words and converted everything to lower case.
